        "content": "Here is a reading passage on a scientific topic at an A2 level, approximately 310 words:\n\n**The Benefits of Recycling**\n\nRecycling is an important part of keeping our planet clean and healthy. When we recycle, we are helping to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and oceans. Did you know that recycling just one plastic bottle can save enough energy to power a computer for three hours?\n\nRecycling also helps to conserve natural resources. For example, when we recycle paper, we are saving trees from being cut down. Trees help to produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, so it's important to keep them healthy.\n\nIn addition, recycling helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. When waste breaks down in landfills, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. By recycling, we can reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and lower our carbon footprint.\n\nRecycling is also important for conserving water. It takes a lot of water to produce new materials, such as steel and glass. When we recycle these materials, we are reducing the need for more water to be used.\n\nFinally, recycling creates jobs. The recycling industry employs thousands of people around the world. By recycling, we are not only helping the environment but also supporting local economies.\n\nSo what can you do to help with recycling? First, make sure to sort your trash into recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, and glass. Then, take it to a recycling center or participate in curbside recycling programs. Every small action counts, and together we can make a big difference in protecting our planet.\n\nI hope you find this passage helpful for practicing your English skills!"
